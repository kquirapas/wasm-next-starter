# Metaprogramming with WASM and NextJS

A WASM and NextJS starter built with Rust.

## Why?

To stay updated and sharp with WASM as well as explore WASM-enabled optimizations in Web3.

## Setup

### Prerequisite

- Install `wasm-pack` ([Here](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack))

### Steps

1. Build `wasm` with `yarn run build-wasm`
2. Remove `.gitignore` in `src/modules/pkg`
3. Run dev `yarn run dev`
